    "bio": "Hi there! I am Sonny! I am a detailed oriented accomplished technical frontend lead, with more than 5 years of experience, as well as proven track record of managing several tasks and large projects on time, working mostly in front-end technologies (React/Redux, and vanilla JS). I enjoy coding for the fun of it, but getting paid to code is even better. I spend my down-time working on various side-projects and contributing to open source. I am highly collaborative person who can work well in groups as well as on my own. I am good in time management as well as in team management which I believe, important aspects to deliver the project successfully.",
